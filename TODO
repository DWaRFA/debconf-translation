* Mappings!
* Other frontends.
* Other demo package files.
* Shell client program.
* Perl client library.

Line at a time frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default.
* Add some way to go back in the Line.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do.
* Doesn't understand mappings.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"

Dialog frontend:
* there is no way to make it prompt for a password, because defaults are
  passed in in cleartext. There should probably be a CAPB setting for this.
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.
* It also really needs to detect when the text it should display is far too
  long, and in that case, display several dialogs in sequence to get rid of
  it. (Breaking at paragrpahs if possible?) This even needs to be done for the
  Input element.
