* Mappings!
* Other frontends.
* Other demo package files.
* Shell client program.
* Perl client library.

Line at a time frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default.
* Add some way to go back in the Line.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do.
* Doesn't understand mappings.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"

Dialog frontend:
* there is no way to make it prompt for a password, because defaults are
  passed in in cleartext. There should probably be a CAPB setting for this.
* it doesn't check ret valules yet..
* The dialog frontend _must_ do dynamic calculations about the size of the
  box. See the cvs stuff for examples of it failing now.
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.
