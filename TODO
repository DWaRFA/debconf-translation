General:
* blah: Illegal seek at /usr/lib/perl5/Debian/DebConf/ConfModule/Base.pm line
  52, <GEN0> chunk 5.
* Modify apt to preconfig stuff.
  [Culus(jgg@tmmi196-038.telusvelocity.net)] apt-pkg/deb/dpkgpm.cc, stick
  another loop at the top of the go function
* dpkg --reconfigure package should run the confmodule and then the
  postinst. Then we don't need special packageconfig scripts anymore.
  W/o modifiying dpkg, a dpkg-reconfig program could handle this.
* The spec says there should be an "isdefault" flag on each variable, that
  is set if the variable is changed from its default.
* Other frontends.
* Working .deb's using the system -- slrn is started as is netbase.
* Proper backend database, but that's a whole other ball of wax.
* The web based frontend displays blank pages with just the bottom buttons
  if low priority questions are asked.
* The debian package needs to have the examples working or removed. Right
  now, they don't really work if used from an installed .deb.
* When dpkg-preconfig is run, it still dumps out dups of the templates, in 2
  places. The crazy thing is, this only seems to happen if you run it in an
  already-installed package. Running it from the source tree doesn't do this.

Line at a time frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default.
* Add some way to go back in the Line.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"

Dialog frontend:
* Input.pm has too many magic numbers in it.
* there is no good way to make it prompt for a password, because defaults are
  passed in in cleartext. There should probably be a CAPB setting for this.
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.

Web based frontend:
* Well, a little security would be nice! It has the same password problem
  dialog has, too.
* It can support blocks, so add them. I guess they could be used for
  arranging questions into tables or something.
* It should have a config screen. In it, you configure the frontend itself.
  One option would be to make it be in "quiet" mode -- this would make it
  not display extended descriptions, just provide links them. Another thing
  to configure would be what priority of questions it is displaying.
