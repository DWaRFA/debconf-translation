General:
* Make sure my spec changes are accepted by Wichert.
* Make messages really be saved to root's mailbox.
* Proper backend database, but that's a whole other ball of wax.
* Config db browser, with AJ's config2 stuff.
* Other frontends.
* Should be able to jump to debconf config when debconf is interacting with
  the user.
* i8n
* When Client::ConfModule launches a frontend, the frontend doesn't see
  stuff echo'd to stdout, if it is echo'd inside a system. A short program
  illistrating the problem:

  *STDOUT=\*NO_STDOUT;
  print "HI 1\n";
  system 'echo HI 2';
  
* Regression tests.
* I need to implement the container template type. That's gonna be fun..
  I've mostly done it now, except it won't work at all with the web
  frontend. I need to make some architectural changes, probably.
* The appendix should use a definition list. (maybe)
* Something I see frequently is a select list that needs lost of explination
  for each option. It'd be neat if the explination could be added as a
  paralell list with the select list, to keep the actual tokens that the
  confmodule script gets back short.
* Add Noninteractive elements. Add a visible field to all elements. If
  priority is too low, one of the non-interactive elements is created, which
  is marked not visible (so the correct thing is returned by INPUT). It is
  then used as normal when GO is called, which might do nothing. For a
  Noninteractive Select Element, it will set the value to the first choice
  (fixing that alloyance consitently). For a Note elemenet, it can log or
  send mail.. In fact, all of them can log stuff.

Text frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default. I could use stty -a to get this info
* Add some way to go back in the Text.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do. One suggestion is to use
  pageup and pagedown -- but I dunnow how to catch those keys in readline.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"
* Shouldn't lower-case choices in a select element.

Dialog frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default. I could use stty -a to get this info
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.

Web based frontend:
* Well, a little security would be nice! It only allows connections
  from localhost, but even that isn't good enough at all.
* Passwords are completly insecure.
* It can support blocks, so add them. I guess they could be used for
  arranging questions into tables or something.
* It should have a config screen. In it, you configure the frontend itself.
  One option would be to make it be in "quiet" mode -- this would make it
  not display extended descriptions, just provide links them. Another thing
  to configure would be what priority of questions it is displaying.

GTK:
* block support
* Back should be disabled unless the confmodule supports it.
* Lots of room here for UI improvements and really showing off everything
  debconf can do.
* segfaults on exit
* I think it's currently completly broken right now. :-(
