General:
* Make sure my spec changes are accepted by Wichert.
* Make messages really be saved to root's mailbox.
* Proper backend database, but that's a whole other ball of wax.
* Config db browser, with AJ's config2 stuff.
* Other frontends.
* Should be able to jump to debconf config when debconf is interacting with
  the user.
* i8n
* Debhelper should auto-add the purge stuff to the postrm when it detects a
  package using debconf.

Text frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default. I could use stty -a to get this info
* Add some way to go back in the Text.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do. One suggestion is to use
  pageup and pagedown -- but I dunnow how to catch those keys in readline.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"


Dialog frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default. I could use stty -a to get this info
* Input.pm has too many magic numbers in it.
* there is no good way to make it prompt for a password. I have a patch to
  newt that allows this, and as soon as it gets in, I'll use it.
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.
* When reconfiguring slrn, with a 25 line display, note how it overlaps with
  the back title; that needs to be fixed.

Web based frontend:
* Well, a little security would be nice! Make sure it only allows connections
  from localhost, but even that isn't good enough at all.
* Passwords are completly insecure.
* It can support blocks, so add them. I guess they could be used for
  arranging questions into tables or something.
* It should have a config screen. In it, you configure the frontend itself.
  One option would be to make it be in "quiet" mode -- this would make it
  not display extended descriptions, just provide links them. Another thing
  to configure would be what priority of questions it is displaying.

GTK:
* block support
* The buttons don't quite work right.
* Lots of room here for UI improvements and really showing off everything
  debconf can do.
* segfaults on exit
* flashes window up even if it's never asked for any questions
