General:
* Make sure my spec changes are accepted by Wichert.
* Make messages really be saved to root's mailbox.
* Proper backend database, but that's a whole other ball of wax.
* Config db browser, with AJ's config2 stuff.
* Other frontends.
* The apt mods don't allow you to predepend on something and then use it in
  a config script. That would be sorta nice to have, but think it through
  first -- is it really necessary? Do we always want config scripts to run
  locally? Etc.
* Should be able to jump to debconf config when debconf is interacting with
  the user.
* When a package is purged, all items in the db it owns and other packages
  don't share with it should be purged.
* i8n
* Get rid of the hack that is a Mapping. They should be unnecessary, just
  have Questions that are linked directly to Templates.

Text frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default.
* Add some way to go back in the Text.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do. One suggestion is to use
  pageup and pagedown -- but I dunnow how to catch those keys in readline.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"

Dialog frontend:
* Input.pm has too many magic numbers in it.
* there is no good way to make it prompt for a password, because defaults are
  passed in in cleartext. There should probably be a CAPB setting for this.
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.

Web based frontend:
* Well, a little security would be nice! Make sure it only allows connections
  from localhost, but even that isn't good enough at all.
* It has the same password problem dialog has, too.
* It can support blocks, so add them. I guess they could be used for
  arranging questions into tables or something.
* It should have a config screen. In it, you configure the frontend itself.
  One option would be to make it be in "quiet" mode -- this would make it
  not display extended descriptions, just provide links them. Another thing
  to configure would be what priority of questions it is displaying.

GTK:
* block support
* The buttons don't quite work right.
* Lots of room here for UI improvements and really showing off everything
  debconf can do.
* segfaults on exit
