* Frontend really shouldn't inherit from confmodule. It makes it too tied
  into communicating with modules when it could be used for other tasks.

* Mappings!
* Other frontends.
* Other demo package files.
* Shell client program.
* Perl client library.

Line at a time frontend:
* It can't tell how high the screen is unless LINES is exported, which
  doesn't seem to be the default.
* Add some way to go back in the Line.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do.
* Doesn't understand mappings.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"
