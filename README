This is a demo frontend for the Debian Configuration Management system. To
test it, try these 4 commands. (The Line frontend works best if
libterm-readline-gnu-perl is installed, but it does not depend on it.)

make test FRONTEND=Dialog PACKAGE=demo
make test FRONTEND=Line PACKAGE=demo
make test FRONTEND=Dialog PACKAGE=cvs
make test FRONTEND=Line PACKAGE=cvs
