This is a demo frontend for the Debian Configuration Management system.

Currently, only a simple line-at-a-time text interface is available, but the
framework is there for more complicated interfaces. The most notable missing
feature in the line-at-a-time interface is the ability to back up to a
previous question. Better interfaces will have that ability.

The current interface works best if libterm-readline-gnu-perl is installed,
but does not depend on it.

'make test' will demo the frontend. To demo it with a few more unimportant
questions, try 'make DEBIAN_PRIORITY=low'. And for only the most critical
questons, try 'make DEBIAN_PRIORITY=critical'.

Another demo is available via 'make test2'.
