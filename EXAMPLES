This is a demo of the the Debian Configuration Management system. To test
it, try these commands. (The Line frontend works best if
libterm-readline-gnu-perl is installed, but it does not depend on it. The
Gtk frontend requires libgtk-perl.)

make test FRONTEND=Dialog PACKAGE=demo
make test FRONTEND=Line PACKAGE=demo
make test FRONTEND=Gtk PACKAGE=demo
make test FRONTEND=Dialog PACKAGE=cvs
make test FRONTEND=Line PACKAGE=cvs
make test FRONTEND=Gtk PACKAGE=cvs
make test FRONTEND=Dialog PACKAGE=exim
make test FRONTEND=Line PACKAGE=exim
make test FRONTEND=Gtk PACKAGE=exim

The cvs demo is actually skipping some questions of low priority. To see
them, try:

make test FRONTEND=Dialog PACKAGE=cvs PRIORITY=low

You can also use PRIORITY=high to skip even more questions.

You can also try the web frontend, just run one of these 3 commands, and
connect to localhost port 8001:

make test FRONTEND=Web PACKAGE=demo
make test FRONTEND=Web PACKAGE=cvs
make test FRONTEND=Web PACKAGE=exim
