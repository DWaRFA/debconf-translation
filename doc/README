The main sources of documentation on debconf for users are:

	- The debconf(7) man page is a complete debconf user's guide.
	- The debconf.conf(5) man page is useful reading if you want to use
	  a different debconf database setup.

Developers should refer to:

	- The debconf-devel(7) man page is a guide for developing packages
	  that use debconf.
	- The debconf specification, which is in the debian-policy
	  package, is a reference to all the available debconf commands.

Though the source for this package can be found on any debian mirror,
development work happens in CVS. You can get a snapshot of the current
development release via CVS, but you'll have to read this page first:
	http://kitenet.net/programs/sshcvs/?debconf

Or you can browse the CVS archives here:
	http://cvs.kitenet.net/joey-cvs/public/packages/debconf/

(We'll be moving it to subversion as soon as we can get the repository
converted.)

Debconf's home page is at http://kitenet.net/programs/debconf/
