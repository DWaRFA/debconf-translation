Overview
--------

This is an attempt at documenting the many objects that form debconf, their
interfaces, methods, and how they interact. It presumes familiarity with the
configuration management specification.

Debconf is composed of these type of objects:

- The backend database. This is responsible for storing and loading
  Templates and Mappings and initiating Questions from them. The following
  modules compose it:
  	- ConfigDb.pm
	- Mapping.pm
	- Question.pm
	- Template.pm
	- Priority.pm
- ConfModules. Contained in the ConfModule/ directory, these objects
  communicate with the real "confmodules" referred to by the specification:
  the scripts inside .deb's that ask questions. There is a different
  ConfModule for each FrontEnd.
- FrontEnds. Contained in the FrontEnd/ directory, these objects present a
  user interface to the user.
- Elements. Contained in the Element/ directory, these objects represent
  user interface elements in a FrontEnd. There are different varieties of
  Elements for each FrontEnd.

For detailed information about any of these modules, see the POD
documentation embedded in them.

Elements
--------

Each element represents one user interface element in a FrontEnd. Elements
can have associated values which are accessed and set in the usual way.
There are 3 types of Elements right now:

- Input: represents a UI element the user can enter input into. It may be a
  button, a text box, a select box, etc. Typically has fields named
  "priority" and "question"
- Text: a peice of text to display to the user. These are intermixed with
  Input items. Typically has field named "priority" and "text".
- Note: a dialog box or similar construct, used for displaying text to the
  user.

For each different FrontEnd, each of these 3 types of Elements must be
implemented. I'll skip all the individual details. Most Elements have the
following method:

	show()
		Display the element, prompting the user for input if necessary.
		Typically also sets the value of the Question bound to this
		Element.

Web based Elements have a show() that outputs html, plus this method:

	set(value)
		Receive a value from the user and deal with it as necessary.
		Typically this sets the value of the Question bound to this
		Element.
