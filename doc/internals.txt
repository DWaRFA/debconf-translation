This is an attempt at documenting the many objects that form debconf, their
interfaces, methods, and how they interact. It presumes familiarity with the
configuration management specification.

Debconf is composed of these type of objects:

- The backend database. This is responsible for storing and loading
  Templates and Questions. The following modules compose it:
  	- ConfigDb.pm
	- Question.pm
	- Template.pm
	- Priority.pm
- ConfModules. Contained in the ConfModule/ directory, these objects
  communicate with the real "confmodules" referred to by the specification:
  the scripts inside .deb's that ask questions. There is a different
  ConfModule for each FrontEnd.
- FrontEnds. Contained in the FrontEnd/ directory, these objects present a
  user interface to the user.
- Elements. Contained in the Element/ directory, these objects represent
  user interface elements in a FrontEnd. There are different varieties of
  Elements for each FrontEnd.

For detailed information about any of these modules, see the POD
documentation embedded in them.
