Debconf is composed of these types of objects:

- The backend database. This is responsible for storing and loading
  Templates and Questions. The following modules compose it:
  	- ConfigDb.pm
	- Question.pm
	- Template.pm
	- Priority.pm
- ConfModules. Contained in the ConfModule/ directory, these objects
  communicate with the real "confmodules" referred to by the specification:
  the scripts inside .deb's that ask questions. There is a different
  ConfModule for each FrontEnd.
- FrontEnds. Contained in the FrontEnd/ directory, these objects present a
  user interface to the user.
- Elements. Contained in the Element/ directory, these objects represent
  user interface elements in a FrontEnd. There are different varieties of
  Elements for each FrontEnd.

For detailed information about any of these modules, see the POD
documentation embedded in them.
