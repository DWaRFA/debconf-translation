I18N:
* I should "use locale" -- but it's not in the base perl package.
  Get it in, or I could hack together my own locale enabler, it's one line
  -- see locale.pm. This is necessary for proper sorting, and other stuff.
* "n. najwy¿szy  w. wysoki  a. ¶redni  b. niski"
  Notice that it did not use ¶ as a letter here. Perhaps it should. OTOH,
  doing so might cause problems with wide character sets, if the first half
  of a character were used.

General:
* When preconfiguring from apt, SIGWINCH signals are ignored. This is an
  apt bug -- a patch is in the BTS and it should be fixed soon.
* Get rid of the horrendous fd #3 hack in /usr/share/debconf/confmodule.
  Unfortuantly, many packages probably depend on the hack. Options are to
  find all such packages (by examining/auditing all packages that use
  debconf), to come up with a new shell interface that is so much cooler
  people will want to migrate to it, and make it not use the hack,
  or to decide with Wichert that debconf should not ursurp stdin/out.
* Proper backend database.
* Config db browser, with AJ's config2 stuff.
* Should be able to jump to debconf config when debconf is interacting with
  the user.
* When Client::ConfModule launches a frontend, the frontend doesn't see
  stuff echo'd to stdout, if it is echo'd inside a system. (Is this still
  true? Test.)
* Regression tests.
* I need to implement the container template type. That's gonna be fun..
  I've mostly done it now, except it won't work at all with the web
  frontend. I need to make some architectural changes, probably.
* Something I see frequently is a select list that needs lots of explination
  for each option. It'd be neat if the explination could be added as a
  parallell list with the select list, to keep the actual tokens that the
  confmodule script gets back short. See modconf for how such a list could
  display in whiptail.

  Dialog frontend couldn't support this, but the rest could.
* I need to update the tutorial with better info on debugging, especially
  since debconf-loadtemplate and debconf-communicate should make it easier.

Slang frontend:
* The buttons should have help text associated with them too.
* Menus to allow controlling of question priority on the fly (?)
* Hotkeys
* Scrolling the ext descriptions!

Text frontend:
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default". I should be able to make this not be an issue
  if GNU Readline is being used anyway, and probably perl readline as well, 
  just not the really dumb version.
* I have a start at completion, but it probably needs to be redesigned before
  I make all the elements use it. Issues:
    - completion needs to be disabled for [more] prompts, but then
      re-enabled after
    - all the elements should not have to reset values to
       defaults, that may have been modified in other elements
    Probably ->prompt needs to be passed a hashref containing the values to
    feed into Attribs; then I can save and restore state, and later wipe out
    all the changes it made.

Dialog frontend:
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.

Web based frontend:
* Well, a little security would be nice! It only allows connections
  from localhost, but even that isn't good enough at all.
* Passwords are completly insecure.
* It can support blocks, so add them. I guess they could be used for
  arranging questions into tables or something.
* It should have a config screen. In it, you configure the frontend itself.
  One option would be to make it be in "quiet" mode -- this would make it
  not display extended descriptions, just provide links them. Another thing
  to configure would be what priority of questions it is displaying.
