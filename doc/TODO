I18N:
* The i18n fixes I made to Select elements in version 0.3.37 still need to
  be done for Multiselect elements.
* I should "use locale" -- but it's not in the base perl package.
  Get it in, or I could hack together my own locale enabler, it's one line
  -- see locale.pm. This is necessary for proper sorting, and other stuff.
* "n. najwy¿szy  w. wysoki  a. ¶redni  b. niski"
  Notice that it did not use ¶ as a letter here. Perhaps it should. OTOH,
  doing so might cause problems with wide character sets, if the first half
  of a character were used.

General:
* Once perlbug ID 20000212.001 is fixed and the fix in in debian, grep -v 
  "perlbug" throughout the source to remove bug workaruond code. I think
  this is fixed in perl 5.6, but I'd have to depend on that version to use
  it, so not quite yet (23 may 00)
* Proper backend database, but that's a whole other ball of wax.
* Config db browser, with AJ's config2 stuff.
* Other frontends.
* Should be able to jump to debconf config when debconf is interacting with
  the user.
* When Client::ConfModule launches a frontend, the frontend doesn't see
  stuff echo'd to stdout, if it is echo'd inside a system. (Is this still
  true? Test.)
* Regression tests.
* I need to implement the container template type. That's gonna be fun..
  I've mostly done it now, except it won't work at all with the web
  frontend. I need to make some architectural changes, probably.
* The appendix should use a definition list. (maybe)
* Something I see frequently is a select list that needs lots of explination
  for each option. It'd be neat if the explination could be added as a
  parallell list with the select list, to keep the actual tokens that the
  confmodule script gets back short. See modconf for how such a list could
  display in whiptail.
* Finish dependncy checks. Currently, they don't handle conflicts, and they
  only look for the first versioned debconf dependancy on a line.

  Dialog frontend couldn't support this, but the rest could.
* I need to update the tutorial with better info on debugging, especially
  since debconf-loadtemplate and debconf-communicate should make it easier.

Slang frontend:
* I doubt resizing always works perfectly.
* Large dropdown select boxes probably go off the screen.
* The buttons should have help text associated with them too.

Text frontend:
* Add some way to go back in the Text.pm front end. I don't know how to
  let the user signal it, which makes it hard to do. One suggestion is to use
  pageup and pagedown -- but I dunnow how to catch those keys in readline.
* If you are entering text, they're no way to enter "" because it is
  interpreted as "use default"

Dialog frontend:
* It'd be nice if the Dialog stuff could catch text that was to be
  displayed that is in the same block, buffer it, and display it up at the top
  when it prompts for an input that is in the same block.

Web based frontend:
* Well, a little security would be nice! It only allows connections
  from localhost, but even that isn't good enough at all.
* Passwords are completly insecure.
* It can support blocks, so add them. I guess they could be used for
  arranging questions into tables or something.
* It should have a config screen. In it, you configure the frontend itself.
  One option would be to make it be in "quiet" mode -- this would make it
  not display extended descriptions, just provide links them. Another thing
  to configure would be what priority of questions it is displaying.
