Description: Tiny subset of debconf for the base system
 Debconf is a configuration management system for debian packages. It is 
 used by some packages to prompt you for questions before they are installed.
 .
 This is a tiny subset of debconf, with only one frontend, no apt
 integration, and few other features. It is intended to be used to set up
 things in the base system that use debconf. Unless you are very short on
 disk space, you should install debconf instead.
