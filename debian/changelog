debconf (0.1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed Line::Boolean default stuff, last time, I hope.

debconf (0.1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had a truely nasty problem: when installing packages using the dialog
    frontend, and using dpkg directly, debconf would segfault shortly after
    the config script was run. It looks like this was due to reentrancy
    problems in my sigchld handler and I think I've squashed it.

debconf (0.1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Expanded the tutorial, it's now a complete standalone document with
    examples. <pant, pant>
  * Oops, I never implemented the reset command! Fixed that.
  * Oops, there are 2 different reset commands! Renamed one to clear,
    contingent on Wichert's approval, and implemented the other as well.
  * Removed dpkg-frontend from the binary package. I really don't want
    people using it.
  * Added pod docs for all Element files. Rather minimal right now.
  * Tested the changes to Client::ConfModule; they work, but I have
    occasional segfaults if using dialog.
  * UI tewak to text boolean element.

debconf (0.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added COPYING file.
  * Renamed README to EXAMPLES.
  * Wrote a new README that just points to the other files.
  * Wrote doc/INTRODUCTION, giving some history of how things
    have worked, and why debconf is better.
  * Suggests libterm-readline-gnu-perl, which is best for the Line
    frontend.
  * dpkg-preconfig uses the frontend specified in the conffile now.
  * Element::Line::Boolean now uses the correct values as the default.
  * FrontEnd::Line now actually displays titles.
  * Client::ConfModule should now run the config script like confmodule.sh
    does, for transparent installation of debconf packages. Needs testing.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 14 Sep 1999 12:48:32 -0700

debconf (0.1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of the DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment variable entirely. Instead,
    /etc/debconf.cfg has a variable in it to specify the default frontend
    to use.
  * Also added a question priority variable to the config file.
  * Oh yeah, the big change is I fixed the postinst hang bug. Or rather,
    worked around it. The bug was caused by update-menus forking to
    background and waiting, but not closing stdin/out. I worked around by
    catching SIGCHLD's and closing the pipes from the other end when the
    postinst has existed. I've also contacted Joost.
  * This, barring a little bit of docs and a few packages built to use it, 
    is basically ready to be shown to the world.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 13 Sep 1999 15:40:15 -0700

debconf (0.1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Broke the nasty perl code out of confmodule.sh, it's much cleaner now
    (and you don't see a page long perl -e command in ps..)
  * I now know exactly what's causing the hang problem -- update-menus!
    I still have no clue why.
  * Modified Client/frontend so it runs the config script of a package
    if the script is available, every time. This is pretty ugly, but it has
    a very nice effect: when you dpkg -i a brand new debconfed .deb, the 
    config script runs as soon as the postinst tries to use debconf, and
    this lets you configure it, and then it is installed. So you don't have
    to dpkg-preconfig it first. Of course, if you're using apt, it is
    preconfiged, and then the config script is run again, redundantly (but
    doesn't do anything since it's already run). This is basically the last
    workaround needed for dpkg not preconfiguring stuff on it's own -- now
    debconf use is completly transparent.

debconf (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use dh_link, so it can still build on va.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 10 Sep 1999 15:08:13 -0700

debconf (0.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gtk::FrontEnd now has the xpm it uses inlined into the file.
  * /etc/debconf.cfg now holds configurable debconf settings. Config.pm is
    just a link to it now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 18:54:53 -0700

debconf (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-reconfigure now sets a flag in FrontEnd::Base that makes old
    questions be shown as well. This is very nice for reconfiguring stuff..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 16:19:21 -0700

debconf (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added db_set command to confmodule.sh

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 16:05:25 -0700

debconf (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uh oh. "set" is a shell builtin, so you cannot access the set command
    via the shell interface. After talking with Sean, I've decided to just
    prefix all the commands in the shell interface with "db_". So dh_set,
    db_get, etc. Most packages that use debconf thus need to be changed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 14:31:45 -0700

debconf (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Back after a one month hiatus. I've moved debconf around in my cvs
    repository, though the debconf module name should still work.
  * Debconf is now FHS compliant.
  * Removed some junk from the Makefile I no longer need.
  * Added doc/packages-prompt, just a list of some packages that need to be
    modified.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 12:05:01 -0700

debconf (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Question->value now returns the default field if value is unset (thanks,
    AJ)
  * Various minor touchups everywhere.
  * Killed slrn sample, this is going into the main slrn package and is
    already significently better in there.
  * Added Element/Gtk/*, from AJ.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  8 Aug 1999 16:00:44 -0700

debconf (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added beginnings of GTK frontend by AJ.
  * Began moving the docs from internals.txt into POD documentation. It was
    getting out of sync with the code, this will prevent that. Only Elements
    still need to be converted.
  * Fixed unset bug in confmodule.sh

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  2 Aug 1999 16:06:33 -0700

debconf (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from AJ that:
    - makes Questions inherit properties direct from their associated
      Templates. This simplifies a lot of code which no longer needs to
      use $question->template->foo.
    - implements STOP command in protocol.
    - dies on unknown questions instead of failing obscurely later.
    - removes bashism
    - misc fixes and updates to cvs.config.
    - adds template substitution support and the SUBST command.
    - makes template parsing work better WRT the extended description and
      actually look for dots on thier own lines, not lines starting with dot.
  * Minor mods to above patch.
  * Documented template substitutions in the draft spec.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jul 1999 00:57:58 -0700

debconf (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of the NOTE and TEXT commands; notes and text are now put on
    templates. This breaks any packages already using debconf (again).
  * The above change made it clear I needed to reorganize the Elements --
    each data type is now a seperate object type. The code is much simpler
    now!
  * While I was doing that, it became possible to make the base ConfModule
    handle command_input in a general way. Much duplicate code removed.
  * Modified clients for above changes.
  * Modified samples and docs for above changes.
  * Made the postrm not fail during error unwind.
  * Picky Sean fixes..
  * Added support for isdefault flag. Now you only see a question once.
  * Added support for the FGET and FSET commands. (untested)
  * The mappings file is no more. All questions on a template will now have
    mappings made for them. If you need others, use the commands to make them.
  * Added a new program, dpkg-reconfigure. Use it to reconfigure an already
    installed package.
  * Added Client/confmodule.sh. This is very similar to Client::ConfModule
    except it's a shell library. 
  * Changed cvs.config to use confmodule.sh. It's _much_ easier to read now.
  * Copyright updates. VA has sponsored and is at least a partial owner of
    this code. It's still GPL'd, of course.
  * Fixed a bug in the web frontend -- if a page is empty now because all
    questions are too low priotity, it just skips it.
  * Fixed a nasty template merge bug.
  * Added a doc/spec/ directory and put a copy of the metadata section of
    the spec in there, converted to html and greatly expanded to match
    reality. This is a draft that I want to get accepted as the real spec.
  * Changed to using "string" as the data type for text data, had been using
    "text". This is a pretty big change, really and breaks all packages that
    have been built so far that use debconf. Have to do it to comply with
    the spec.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 30 Jul 1999 11:16:25 -0700

debconf (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig (and test.pl) now load up only the COnfModules and
    FrontEnds that will really be used. Faster startup time.
  * TODO updates.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jul 1999 15:36:53 -0700

debconf (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig now has a --apt option that makes it read debs to
    configure on stdin. This is for use with apt of course. (A hacked apt
    that can use this exists now.)
  * Dialog frontend only clears the screen just before displaying a
    non-gdialog dialog box.
  * Depend on the version of apt that really works with debconf.
  * A postinst and postrm modify /etc/apt/apt.conf to make apt use
    dpkg-preconfig to configure packages. (The file's not actually part of
    apt, so this is not too evil).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jul 1999 11:41:29 -0700

debconf (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved CREDITS to doc/.
  * Install internals.txt in .deb.
  * doc/maintainer.txt is a guide for maintainers who want to convert
    packages to use debconf.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jul 1999 20:37:50 -0700

debconf (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Killed the cvs date stuff. Too much bother.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  8 Jul 1999 13:38:37 -0700
