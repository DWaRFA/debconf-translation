debconf (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from AJ that:
    - makes Questions inherit properties direct from their associated
      Templates. This simplifies a lot of code which no longer needs to
      use $question->template->foo.
    - implements STOP command in protocol.
    - dies on unknown questions instead of failing obscurely later.
    - removes bashism
    - misc fixes and updates to cvs.config.
    - adds template substitution support and the SUBST command.
    - makes template parsing work better WRT the extended description and
      actually look for dots on thier own lines, not lines starting with dot.
  * Minor mods to above patch.
  * Documented template substitutions in the draft spec.

debconf (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of the NOTE and TEXT commands; notes and text are now put on
    templates. This breaks any packages already using debconf (again).
  * The above change made it clear I needed to reorganize the Elements --
    each data type is now a seperate object type. The code is much simpler
    now!
  * While I was doing that, it became possible to make the base ConfModule
    handle command_input in a general way. Much duplicate code removed.
  * Modified clients for above changes.
  * Modified samples and docs for above changes.
  * Made the postrm not fail during error unwind.
  * Picky Sean fixes..
  * Added support for isdefault flag. Now you only see a question once.
  * Added support for the FGET and FSET commands. (untested)
  * The mappings file is no more. All questions on a template will now have
    mappings made for them. If you need others, use the commands to make them.
  * Added a new program, dpkg-reconfigure. Use it to reconfigure an already
    installed package.
  * Added Client/confmodule.sh. This is very similar to Client::ConfModule
    except it's a shell library. 
  * Changed cvs.config to use confmodule.sh. It's _much_ easier to read now.
  * Copyright updates. VA has sponsored and is at least a partial owner of
    this code. It's still GPL'd, of course.
  * Fixed a bug in the web frontend -- if a page is empty now because all
    questions are too low priotity, it just skips it.
  * Fixed a nasty template merge bug.
  * Added a doc/spec/ directory and put a copy of the metadata section of
    the spec in there, converted to html and greatly expanded to match
    reality. This is a draft that I want to get accepted as the real spec.
  * Changed to using "string" as the data type for text data, had been using
    "text". This is a pretty big change, really and breaks all packages that
    have been built so far that use debconf. Have to do it to comply with
    the spec.

debconf (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig (and test.pl) now load up only the COnfModules and
    FrontEnds that will really be used. Faster startup time.
  * TODO updates.

debconf (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig now has a --apt option that makes it read debs to
    configure on stdin. This is for use with apt of course. (A hacked apt
    that can use this exists now.)
  * Dialog frontend only clears the screen just before displaying a
    non-gdialog dialog box.
  * Depend on the version of apt that really works with debconf.
  * A postinst and postrm modify /etc/apt/apt.conf to make apt use
    dpkg-preconfig to configure packages. (The file's not actually part of
    apt, so this is not too evil).

debconf (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved CREDITS to doc/.
  * Install internals.txt in .deb.
  * doc/maintainer.txt is a guide for maintainers who want to convert
    packages to use debconf.

debconf (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Killed the cvs date stuff. Too much bother.
