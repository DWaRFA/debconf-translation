debconf (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig (and test.pl) now load up only the COnfModules and
    FrontEnds that will really be used. Faster startup time.
  * TODO updates.

debconf (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig now has a --apt option that makes it read debs to
    configure on stdin. This is for use with apt of course. (A hacked apt
    that can use this exists now.)
  * Dialog frontend only clears the screen just before displaying a
    non-gdialog dialog box.
  * Depend on the version of apt that really works with debconf.
  * A postinst and postrm modify /etc/apt/apt.conf to make apt use
    dpkg-preconfig to configure packages. (The file's not actually part of
    apt, so this is not too evil).

debconf (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved CREDITS to doc/.
  * Install internals.txt in .deb.
  * doc/maintainer.txt is a guide for maintainers who want to convert
    packages to use debconf.

debconf (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Killed the cvs date stuff. Too much bother.
