debconf (0.1.75) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed confmodule.sh reentrancy problem.
  * Fixed a problem with empty text input fields in the Dialog frontend
    setting the value of the question back to default instead of to ''

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 28 Oct 1999 12:41:41 -0700

debconf (0.1.74) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a very important note to the tutorial.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 27 Oct 1999 15:38:42 -0700

debconf (0.1.73) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the dialog frontend, if a prompt is too big to fit on a dialog and
    has to be slit up, it will now display just the extended description
    in a dialog, and then display a new dialog with the short description
    and the actual input element in it. This is intended to reduce confusion
    when a user sees a question at the bottom of a dialog and an "Ok"
    button beneath it -- that won't happen any more, and I think it's
    ok to say this change Closes: #47644
  * Reduced the amount of code in Dialog Elments a lot.
  * Fixed yet another bug in dialog select box sizing. WIll they never end?
  * Dialog select boxes no longer have numbered items. Looks better.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 27 Oct 1999 14:14:51 -0700

debconf (0.1.72) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig: fixed so it chomps the package name, to prevent ugliness
    like \n in the owners field. Closes: #48450

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 27 Oct 1999 12:48:54 -0700

debconf (0.1.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * The dialog frontend can now use --passwordbox with both whiptail and
    dialog, so I made that change. (Closes: #47196)
  * Added a section to the tutorail on adding backup capabilities to config
    scripts. (Closes: #47676)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 26 Oct 1999 15:02:10 -0700

debconf (0.1.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some work done towards supporting containers.
  * Config scripts are now passed the version of the package that is currently
    installed when they are run, which is normally the old version of the
    package. (Analagous to postinst scripts.)

debconf (0.1.69) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the web frontend to send a HTTP reponse header, patch from
    Fumitoshi UKAI <ukai@debian.or.jp>, Closes: #47937

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 1999 16:19:43 -0700

debconf (0.1.68) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/newbie/politically_correct_language()/eg;
    Closes: #47668
  * With regards to the second part of that bug report: critical is first on
    the list, and always has been, unless you are using the dialog frontend,
    where I have to do nasty re-ordering to make the default be first. If
    you want, file a seperate (wishlist) bug on this.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 1999 15:26:34 -0700

debconf (0.1.67) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a truely braindead problem in Container.pm, which was breaking
    Select Elements a bit. (Closes: #47683)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 1999 15:14:17 -0700

debconf (0.1.66) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in debconf template. (Closes: #47458)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 1999 14:44:24 -0700

debconf (0.1.65) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Rafael Laboissiere to add an "exists" command.
    Be warned that this command is probably only temporary, I am looking
    for a better solution. (Closes: #46927)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 12 Oct 1999 13:52:43 -0700

debconf (0.1.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * Slighly better handing of select element in text frontend if it has more
    than 26 choices.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 10 Oct 1999 22:30:13 -0700

debconf (0.1.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed text fromtend boolean input element to return true if true is
    the default. (Closes: #47049)
  * Fixed tutorial typo. (Closes: #47050)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  9 Oct 1999 18:11:24 -0700

debconf (0.1.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added stylesheet to turn on toc's.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  8 Oct 1999 21:31:31 -0700

debconf (0.1.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted the tutorial and introduction to xml and docbook.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  8 Oct 1999 16:26:17 -0700

debconf (0.1.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled gdialog support just temporariy.
  * Works with the latest dialog in unstable, re-enabled dialog support.
  * Dialog select boxes are now indexed starting at 1, not 0.
  * Documented a confmodule.sh gotcha in a tew troubleshooting section of
    the tutorial.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  8 Oct 1999 09:36:02 -0700

debconf (0.1.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Guarded postinst code that modifies apt.conf to prevent dup entries.
  * Started doing some cleanup of the gtk frontend:
    - It no longer flashes the window up on the screen unless it really
      has a question to ask this time around.
    - Made cancel button work.
    It still segfaults on exit though. 

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  7 Oct 1999 18:21:35 -0700

debconf (0.1.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allowed confmodule.sh to be loaded twice. Closes: #46843

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  7 Oct 1999 14:44:30 -0700

debconf (0.1.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from rafael@icp.inpg.fr (Rafael Laboissiere) to fix a perl warning,
    Closes: #46871
  * Another patch from Rafael to fix a mistake in the tutorial. Closes: #46873

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  7 Oct 1999 13:40:02 -0700

debconf (0.1.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wrote a perl module dependancy grapher, and include output in the .deb
    package. I need to clean up parts of the Element hierarchy. Running this
    on all perl modules in /usr/lib/perl is amusing, too, though it needs
    some more work to be of general utility. (And I suspect someone has
    already written a better one I'm not aware of.)
  * Made a new frontend -- the Noninteractive frontend.
  * All objects in debconf now derive from a common base class, which saved
    a few dozen lines of code at least.
  * There is now only one ConfModule object, no more multiple derived
    objects per FrontEnd type. To make this work, I had to move the capb
    property into the FrontEnd.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  7 Oct 1999 02:52:02 -0700

debconf (0.1.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reorganized some modules. No user-visible changes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed,  6 Oct 1999 16:20:43 -0700

debconf (0.1.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gtk frontend can use the newest gtk-perl to test whether opening the
    display will work. Closes: #46736
  * metaget'ing choices now returns a list. Fixes the other half of #46606.
  * Select boxes that consist of one item are not displayed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed,  6 Oct 1999 11:21:01 -0700

debconf (0.1.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected db_text command in confmodule.sh, Closes: #46640
  * Corrected typo in confmodule.3 man page, Closes: #46651
  * Corrected whiptail window sizing problems, Closes: #46498, #46655

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue,  5 Oct 1999 11:21:25 -0700

debconf (0.1.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed fatal dpkg-reconfig typo.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  4 Oct 1999 15:45:32 -0700

debconf (0.1.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debconf config scripts are now called with options. "configure" is
    normally passed, "reconfigure" is passed if dpkg-reconfig is
    reconfiguring the package. After that, the version of the package is
    passed.
  * dpkg-reconfigure will only work on packages that are fully installed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  4 Oct 1999 14:12:56 -0700

debconf (0.1.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected several errors with how the choices field is accessed.
    (Closes: #46606)
  * No longer parses the choices field at template load time. This is a
    big change and might break stuff -- we'll see.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  4 Oct 1999 11:26:32 -0700

debconf (0.1.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a simple little progress report display to dpkg-preconfig so
    when apt passes it 200 packages to be upgraded on a 386, it's clear
    that something is actually going on.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 1999 18:04:38 -0700

debconf (0.1.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quoted a few more bareword hash keys that were causing a perl warning. What
    puzzles me is I cannot reproduce the warning at all.. (Closes: #46545)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 1999 17:18:36 -0700

debconf (0.1.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * Doh -- I need to update to use debhelper's debconf support! :-)
  * Gdialog only takes --defaultno options at the end. Dialog only takes
    than at the beginning. Whiptail takes them either place. Argh. I've
    changed to using the end for now, since I don't use dialog at all yet.
  * Disambiguated {owners} in Question.pm, Closes: #46347
  * Killed EXAMPLES out of the debian package.
  * Flipped ordering of short and long descriptions in notes and text in the
    dialog frontend; makes more sense this way.
  * dpkg-reconfigure aborts if you arn't root.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  1 Oct 1999 13:31:06 -0700

debconf (0.1.46) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yesterday's changes to the choices field broke all select lists -- fixed.
  * Added regression tests to TODO, it's clear I need them.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 30 Sep 1999 23:06:49 -0700

debconf (0.1.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the README to refer to the locations of docs in the installed
    .deb, rather than the tarball, now that most people are installing debs.
    Closes: #46302.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 30 Sep 1999 11:49:12 -0700

debconf (0.1.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the metaget command. I did this mainly to let one get a list of
    the owners of a question, though it might have other uses later.
  * Substitutions now take effect on the choices field as well as the
    description field.
  * Put these two changes together and it's now possible to install several
    related packages (ispell dictionaries, say), and get a list of what
    dictionaries are available when the config scripts run, and only prompt
    the user once for which one they want. Added a section to the tutorial
    about this.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 29 Sep 1999 15:52:14 -0700

debconf (0.1.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the problems with the purge command, which were really package
    name guessing problems and some errors in the new purge code. BenC, it's
    ready for you.
  * Don't install frontend in /bin (Closes: #46149)
  * Fixed a problem with interpretation of the set command. The second
    parameter can have spaces in it.
  * Added data-dumper dependancy, since some perl's don't include it.
    (Closes: #46147)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 28 Sep 1999 17:17:42 -0700

debconf (0.1.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a problem with Client::ConfModule.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 27 Sep 1999 16:12:32 -0700

debconf (0.1.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Peter Vreman <pfv@cooldown.demon.nl> to correct dialog
    size guessing code. Did some additional fixes for whiptail. 
    (Closes: 46060)
  * Fixed a really silly formatting bug in FrontEnd::Dialog that was
    probably leading to what looked like corrupted displays for some people.
  * When breaking a question up over multiple screens with dialog, it makes
    sure to always show the short description when it actually prompts for
    input. This is a lot less disorienting.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 27 Sep 1999 14:41:57 -0700

debconf (0.1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * gdialog will soon support --defaultno, added versionsed conflicts
    with versions that don't, and support it again.
  * ConfModule::new() doesn't take a confmodule to start anymore, I broke
    that out into a separate function.
  * AutoSelect only starts up the script if it's actually passed once. TRhis
    should fix your problem, BenC.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 26 Sep 1999 18:16:47 -0700

debconf (0.1.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hm, I know I fixed this before, but the fix seems to have been lost:
    Fixed bug in the AutoSelect that was making it *always* try dialog
    first, even if something else was picked. (Closes: #46020)
  * Dialog has no --defaultno flag, which makes it unusable for debconf.
    Oh, so does gdialog. I have submitted a patch for dialog, but for now
    I have simply made debconf not accept dialog. If you don't have whiptail,
    you get text mode. I also made the --defaultno flag be passed first,
    which is how dialog will (eventually) support it. (Closes: #46047)
  * Dialog frontend no longer clears the screen when running. Makes it
    easier to get at debug messages. (Closes: #46048)
  * dpkg-reconfigure was trashing ownerships, fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 26 Sep 1999 16:50:02 -0700

debconf (0.1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added password data type. Currently supported by the Text frontend
    (though it has problems displaying right in an xterm), the Gtk frontend, 
    and the Web frontend (though you'd be insane to use it!).
  * Fixed a nasty bug in the fallback code.
  * Read-protected the debconf db directory.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Sep 1999 20:13:20 -0700

debconf (0.1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a problem if perl failed to configure and dpkg-preconfig then
    bombed out on the next apt run, users would have an unusable apt and not
    be able to fix their system. Now dpkg-preconfigure detects a broken perl
    and exits sanely, allowing apt to continue and fix things. 
    (Closes: #45927)
  * Fixed a dpkg-preconfig type introduced last version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Sep 1999 15:55:51 -0700

debconf (0.1.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added fallback frontend support. If the frontend the user selects is not
    available, or fails to initialize (say DISPLAY is unset for Gtk), it will
    fall back intelligently to another frontend.
  * This means debconf doesn't really depend on much at all except perl.
    Moved most stuff to suggests.
  * The Gtk frontend was dying in a way not catchable by eval (!!) if DISPLAY
    was unset; added a fix to that so it falls back instead.
  * Removed some dpkg-preconfig spam.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Sep 1999 13:25:12 -0700

debconf (0.1.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mappings. What good are they? None, that I could see, so I completely
    removed them! This doesn't influence debconf's behavior at all, just
    removes many lines of code and makes it all easier to understand.
  * Added the concept that each question is owned by one or more packages.
    When the number of owners goes to zero, the question is removed.
  * Whenever a question is removed, I check to see if the template it used
    is no longer used as well. If so, it's also removed.
  * What this lets us do is it allows packages to get rid of questions and
    templates they created when they are purged. And shared questions are
    fully supported and won't go away until the last package that uses them
    does.
  * Added a "purge" command that accomplishes this easily. (You could of
    course always call unregister by hand for each question, but this is
    easier.)
  * Modifed dpkg-preconfig so all the templates in all the packages that
    are being installed are read first, and then all the config scripts are
    run.
  * The changes above have an intriguing side benefit that offers a fix to a
    vexing problem. There is now a field in each question called "owners", that
    is a comma and space delimited list of the packages that have registered
    ownership. This list is up to date as soon as all the templates are
    loaded if apt is used. A set of related packages can all provide the same
    template in them; and their config scripts can then look at the owners
    field to get the list of all related packages that is/will be installed.
    Then they can do things like turn that into a list of choices of window
    managers, or ispell dictionaries, etc, and prompt the user to pick one.
    This feels only a little hackish, and the only problem with it is that if
    they are not installing with apt, the list isn't fully complete until each
    and every package has been installed.
  * Fixed question default value code so it always inherits from the current
    template, whatever that might be.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 23 Sep 1999 12:52:14 -0700

debconf (0.1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dpkg-reconfigure, which was broken since yesterday.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 22 Sep 1999 15:48:57 -0700

debconf (0.1.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed template merge bug. This was making old descriptions show up
    even if a new template with changed descriptions was loaded.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 22 Sep 1999 15:07:03 -0700

debconf (0.1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now it properly handles config scripts and postinsts that exit with
    a return code, by propigating that return code up to dpkg.
  * Killed dpkg-frnotend for good. It's in the Attic now only.
  * In the dialog frontend, hitting cancel (or escape, maybe), will now
    break out and cancel everything.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 21 Sep 1999 15:01:00 -0700

debconf (0.1.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "visible" command to tell if a question will be displayed.
    Very useful for preventing some kinds of loops.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 20 Sep 1999 17:12:00 -0700

debconf (0.1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper now supports debconf, amended turorial to note this.
  * More spelling fixes.
  * Added doc/namespace.ttx, which explains the variable namespace.
  * First upload to unstable.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 17 Sep 1999 12:28:14 -0700

debconf (0.1.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from James R. Van Zandt <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com> with:
    - spelling corrections
    - man page enhancements
    - better debian/templates text

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 19 Sep 1999 13:04:50 -0700

debconf (0.1.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 1999 17:00:55 -0700

debconf (0.1.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added default title support.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 1999 14:51:36 -0700

debconf (0.1.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a config script and templates for debconf itself. It uses
    them to configure what frontend to use, etc. /etc/debconf.cfg is no
    more.
  * Modified Config.pm so it contains functions that return values,
    not just hard coded values. The functions now try to pull values out of
    the database, and fall back on the defaults. Also, environment 
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND always works for specifying a frontend now, overriding
    all else.
  * Changed a myriad of other files that use Config.pm to call the new
    functions.
  * The Priority module is no longer used to set priority, Config.pm can
    handle that now.
  * Added showold to Config.pm, you can always see old questions now, if
    you like.
  * Renamed the entire Line frontend to Text. Line really doesn't make as
    much sense. If you're following long in CVS, I also probably broke your
    repository again; a clean checkout is reccommended. Sorry.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 1999 12:56:43 -0700

debconf (0.1.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the dialog frontend. Short descriptions now appear after long,
    instead of as dialog titles. The title appears as the dialo title, and
    the background title is "Debian Configuration"
  * Hm, that actually cleaned up the API a bit, I guess it was the right
    thing to do.
  * Fixed link.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 1999 11:48:53 -0700

debconf (0.1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added advanced topics section to the tutorial.

debconf (0.1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force use of gnu readline perl library. The other one is too bad.
  * dpkg-reconfigure allows you to configure it's frontend now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 17 Sep 1999 18:03:19 -0700

debconf (0.1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a typo in the tutorial, and expanded it some.
  * Fixed the apt dependancy, which was on too low a version.
  * Depend on whiptail || dialog || gnome-utils so some kind of dialog is
    installed always.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 17 Sep 1999 17:48:12 -0700

debconf (0.1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * All the sigchld counting and handling stuff was making debconf segfault
    and making it fragile in various ways. Removed it. Instead, I have
    modified update-menus to DTRT, and I depend on that version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 16 Sep 1999 17:10:06 -0700

debconf (0.1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed Line::Boolean default stuff, last time, I hope.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 16 Sep 1999 16:18:47 -0700

debconf (0.1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had a truely nasty problem: when installing packages using the dialog
    frontend, and using dpkg directly, debconf would segfault shortly after
    the config script was run. It looks like this was due to reentrancy
    problems in my sigchld handler and I think I've squashed it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 16 Sep 1999 12:22:48 -0700

debconf (0.1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Expanded the tutorial, it's now a complete standalone document with
    examples. <pant, pant>
  * Oops, I never implemented the reset command! Fixed that.
  * Oops, there are 2 different reset commands! Renamed one to clear,
    contingent on Wichert's approval, and implemented the other as well.
  * Removed dpkg-frontend from the binary package. I really don't want
    people using it.
  * Added pod docs for all Element files. Rather minimal right now.
  * Tested the changes to Client::ConfModule; they work, but I have
    occasional segfaults if using dialog.
  * UI tewak to text boolean element.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 15 Sep 1999 11:35:45 -0700

debconf (0.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added COPYING file.
  * Renamed README to EXAMPLES.
  * Wrote a new README that just points to the other files.
  * Wrote doc/INTRODUCTION, giving some history of how things
    have worked, and why debconf is better.
  * Suggests libterm-readline-gnu-perl, which is best for the Line
    frontend.
  * dpkg-preconfig uses the frontend specified in the conffile now.
  * Element::Line::Boolean now uses the correct values as the default.
  * FrontEnd::Line now actually displays titles.
  * Client::ConfModule should now run the config script like confmodule.sh
    does, for transparent installation of debconf packages. Needs testing.

debconf (0.1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of the DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment variable entirely. Instead,
    /etc/debconf.cfg has a variable in it to specify the default frontend
    to use.
  * Also added a question priority variable to the config file.
  * Oh yeah, the big change is I fixed the postinst hang bug. Or rather,
    worked around it. The bug was caused by update-menus forking to
    background and waiting, but not closing stdin/out. I worked around by
    catching SIGCHLD's and closing the pipes from the other end when the
    postinst has existed. I've also contacted Joost.
  * This, barring a little bit of docs and a few packages built to use it, 
    is basically ready to be shown to the world.

debconf (0.1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Broke the nasty perl code out of confmodule.sh, it's much cleaner now
    (and you don't see a page long perl -e command in ps..)
  * I now know exactly what's causing the hang problem -- update-menus!
    I still have no clue why.
  * Modified Client/frontend so it runs the config script of a package
    if the script is available, every time. This is pretty ugly, but it has
    a very nice effect: when you dpkg -i a brand new debconfed .deb, the 
    config script runs as soon as the postinst tries to use debconf, and
    this lets you configure it, and then it is installed. So you don't have
    to dpkg-preconfig it first. Of course, if you're using apt, it is
    preconfiged, and then the config script is run again, redundantly (but
    doesn't do anything since it's already run). This is basically the last
    workaround needed for dpkg not preconfiguring stuff on it's own -- now
    debconf use is completly transparent.

debconf (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use dh_link, so it can still build on va.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 10 Sep 1999 15:08:13 -0700

debconf (0.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gtk::FrontEnd now has the xpm it uses inlined into the file.
  * /etc/debconf.cfg now holds configurable debconf settings. Config.pm is
    just a link to it now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 18:54:53 -0700

debconf (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-reconfigure now sets a flag in FrontEnd::Base that makes old
    questions be shown as well. This is very nice for reconfiguring stuff..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 16:19:21 -0700

debconf (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added db_set command to confmodule.sh

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 16:05:25 -0700

debconf (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uh oh. "set" is a shell builtin, so you cannot access the set command
    via the shell interface. After talking with Sean, I've decided to just
    prefix all the commands in the shell interface with "db_". So dh_set,
    db_get, etc. Most packages that use debconf thus need to be changed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 14:31:45 -0700

debconf (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Back after a one month hiatus. I've moved debconf around in my cvs
    repository, though the debconf module name should still work.
  * Debconf is now FHS compliant.
  * Removed some junk from the Makefile I no longer need.
  * Added doc/packages-prompt, just a list of some packages that need to be
    modified.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 1999 12:05:01 -0700

debconf (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Question->value now returns the default field if value is unset (thanks,
    AJ)
  * Various minor touchups everywhere.
  * Killed slrn sample, this is going into the main slrn package and is
    already significently better in there.
  * Added Element/Gtk/*, from AJ.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  8 Aug 1999 16:00:44 -0700

debconf (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added beginnings of GTK frontend by AJ.
  * Began moving the docs from internals.txt into POD documentation. It was
    getting out of sync with the code, this will prevent that. Only Elements
    still need to be converted.
  * Fixed unset bug in confmodule.sh

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  2 Aug 1999 16:06:33 -0700

debconf (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from AJ that:
    - makes Questions inherit properties direct from their associated
      Templates. This simplifies a lot of code which no longer needs to
      use $question->template->foo.
    - implements STOP command in protocol.
    - dies on unknown questions instead of failing obscurely later.
    - removes bashism
    - misc fixes and updates to cvs.config.
    - adds template substitution support and the SUBST command.
    - makes template parsing work better WRT the extended description and
      actually look for dots on thier own lines, not lines starting with dot.
  * Minor mods to above patch.
  * Documented template substitutions in the draft spec.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jul 1999 00:57:58 -0700

debconf (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of the NOTE and TEXT commands; notes and text are now put on
    templates. This breaks any packages already using debconf (again).
  * The above change made it clear I needed to reorganize the Elements --
    each data type is now a seperate object type. The code is much simpler
    now!
  * While I was doing that, it became possible to make the base ConfModule
    handle command_input in a general way. Much duplicate code removed.
  * Modified clients for above changes.
  * Modified samples and docs for above changes.
  * Made the postrm not fail during error unwind.
  * Picky Sean fixes..
  * Added support for isdefault flag. Now you only see a question once.
  * Added support for the FGET and FSET commands. (untested)
  * The mappings file is no more. All questions on a template will now have
    mappings made for them. If you need others, use the commands to make them.
  * Added a new program, dpkg-reconfigure. Use it to reconfigure an already
    installed package.
  * Added Client/confmodule.sh. This is very similar to Client::ConfModule
    except it's a shell library. 
  * Changed cvs.config to use confmodule.sh. It's _much_ easier to read now.
  * Copyright updates. VA has sponsored and is at least a partial owner of
    this code. It's still GPL'd, of course.
  * Fixed a bug in the web frontend -- if a page is empty now because all
    questions are too low priotity, it just skips it.
  * Fixed a nasty template merge bug.
  * Added a doc/spec/ directory and put a copy of the metadata section of
    the spec in there, converted to html and greatly expanded to match
    reality. This is a draft that I want to get accepted as the real spec.
  * Changed to using "string" as the data type for text data, had been using
    "text". This is a pretty big change, really and breaks all packages that
    have been built so far that use debconf. Have to do it to comply with
    the spec.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 30 Jul 1999 11:16:25 -0700

debconf (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig (and test.pl) now load up only the COnfModules and
    FrontEnds that will really be used. Faster startup time.
  * TODO updates.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jul 1999 15:36:53 -0700

debconf (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-preconfig now has a --apt option that makes it read debs to
    configure on stdin. This is for use with apt of course. (A hacked apt
    that can use this exists now.)
  * Dialog frontend only clears the screen just before displaying a
    non-gdialog dialog box.
  * Depend on the version of apt that really works with debconf.
  * A postinst and postrm modify /etc/apt/apt.conf to make apt use
    dpkg-preconfig to configure packages. (The file's not actually part of
    apt, so this is not too evil).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jul 1999 11:41:29 -0700

debconf (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved CREDITS to doc/.
  * Install internals.txt in .deb.
  * doc/maintainer.txt is a guide for maintainers who want to convert
    packages to use debconf.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jul 1999 20:37:50 -0700

debconf (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Killed the cvs date stuff. Too much bother.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  8 Jul 1999 13:38:37 -0700
