Template: debconf/frontend
Type: select
Choices: Dialog, Text, Gtk, Web
Default: Dialog
Description: What frontend should be used for configuring packages?
 Packages that use debconf for configuration share a common look and feel.
 You can select the type of user interface they all use.
 .
 The dialog frontend provides a full-screen, character based interface using
 the ncurses library. The gtk frontend requires the X window system. The
 web frontend can be accessed using your favorite browser.
 .
 Note that the gtk and web frontends still need some work; use them at your
 own risk.

Template: debconf/priority
Type: select
Choices: critical, high, medium, low
Default: low
Description: Ignore questions with a priority less than..
 Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the questions they
 might ask you. Only questions with a certain priority or higher are actually
 shown to you; all less important questions are skipped and the defaults are
 used for them.
 .
 You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see: `low' is for
 trivial items that have defaults that will work in the vast majority of
 cases. `medium' is for normal items that have reasonable defaults.  `high'
 is for items that don't have reasonable defaults. `critical' is for items
 that will probably break the system without user intervention. For example,
 this question is of medium priority, and if your priority were already
 `high' or `critical', you wouldn't see this question.
 .
 If you're a newbie, pick `critical' now, so you only see the most important
 questions.

Template: debconf/showold
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Show all old questions again and again?
 Debconf normally only asks you any given question once. Then it remembers
 your answer and never asks you that question again. If you prefer, debconf
 can ask you questions over and over again, each time you upgrade or reinstall
 a package that asks them.
 .
 Note that no matter what you choose here, you can see old questions again by
 using the dpkg-reconfigure program.
 .
 Also note that if you do enable this, you will in fact be asked twice per
 upgrade, if using apt.
