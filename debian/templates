Template: debconf/frontend
Type: select
Choices: Dialog, Text, Gtk, Web
Default: Dialog
Description: What frontend should be used for configuring packages?
 Packages that use debconf for configuration share a common look and feel.
 You can select the type of user interface they all use.
 .
 Note that the gtk and web frontends still need some work; use them at your
 own risk.

Template: debconf/priority
Type: select
Choices: critical, high, medium, low
Default: low
Description: Ignore questions with a priority less than..
 Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the questions they
 might ask you. Only questions with a certian priority or higher are actually
 shown to you; all less important questions are skipped and the defaults are
 used for them.
 .
 You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see. For example,
 this question is of medium priority, and if your priority was already 'high'
 or 'critical', you wouldn't see this question.
 .
 If you're a newbie, pick "critical" now, so you only see the most important
 questions.

Template: debconf/showold
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Show all old question again and again?
 Debconf normally only askes you any given question once. Then it remembers
 your answer and never asks you that question again. If you prefer, debconf
 can ask you questions over and over again, each time you upgrade or reinstall
 a package that asks them.
 .
 Note that no matter what you choose here, you can see old questions again by
 using the dpkg--reconfigure program.
