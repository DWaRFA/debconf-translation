Template: debconf/frontend
Type: select
Choices: Dialog, Text, Web, Noninteractive
Default: Dialog
Description: What frontend should be used for configuring packages?
 Packages that use debconf for configuration share a common look and feel.
 You can select the type of user interface they all use.
 .
 The dialog frontend provides a full-screen, character based interface using
 the ncurses library, while the text frontend uses a more traditional plain
 text interface. The web frontend can be accessed using your favorite
 browser. The noninteractive frontend never asks you any questions.

Template: debconf/priority
Type: select
Choices: critical, high, medium, low
Default: medium
Description: Ignore questions with a priority less than..
 Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the questions they
 might ask you. Only questions with a certain priority or higher are actually
 shown to you; all less important questions are skipped and the defaults are
 used for them.
 .
 You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see: `low' is for
 trivial items that have defaults that will work in the vast majority of
 cases. `medium' is for normal items that have reasonable defaults.  `high'
 is for items that don't have reasonable defaults. `critical' is for items
 that will probably break the system without user intervention. For example,
 this question is of medium priority, and if your priority were already
 `high' or `critical', you wouldn't see this question.
 .
 If you are new to the Debian GNU/Linux system choose `critical' now,
 so you only see the most important questions.

Template: debconf/preconfig
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Pre-configure packages before they are installed?
 Debconf can be used to configure packages before they are installed by apt.
 This lets you answer most questions a package would ask at the beginning of
 the install, so you do not need to be around to answer questions during the
 rest of the install.

Template: debconf/showold
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Show all old questions again and again?
 Debconf normally only asks you any given question once. Then it remembers
 your answer and never asks you that question again. If you prefer, debconf
 can ask you questions over and over again, each time you upgrade or reinstall
 a package that asks them.
 .
 Note that no matter what you choose here, you can see old questions again by
 using the dpkg-reconfigure program.
