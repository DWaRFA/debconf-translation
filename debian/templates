Template: debconf/frontend
Type: select
_Choices: Dialog, Readline, Gnome, Editor, Noninteractive
Default: Dialog
_Description: What interface should be used for configuring packages?
 Packages that use debconf for configuration share a common look and feel.
 You can select the type of user interface they use.
 .
 The dialog frontend is a full-screen, character based interface, while the
 readline frontend uses a more traditional plain text interface, and the
 gnome frontend is a modern X interface. The editor frontend lets you
 configure things using your favorite text editor. The noninteractive
 frontend never asks you any questions.

Template: debconf/priority
Type: select
_Choices: critical, high, medium, low
Default: medium
_Description: See only questions that are of what priority and higher?
 Debconf prioritizes the questions it asks you. Pick the lowest priority of
 question you want to see:
   - 'critical' only prompts you if the system might break.
     Pick it if you are a newbie, or in a hurry.
   - 'high' is for rather important questions
   - 'medium' is for normal questions
   - 'low' is for control freaks who want to see everything
 .
 Note that no matter what level you pick here, you will be able to see
 every question if you reconfigure a package with dpkg-reconfigure.
